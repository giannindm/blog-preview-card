## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

### Screenshot

![](./screenshot.jpg)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it. 

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

**Note: Delete this note and the paragraphs above when you add your screenshot. If you prefer not to add a screenshot, feel free to remove this entire section.**

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

**Note: These are just examples. Delete this note and replace the list above with your own choices**

### What I learned

- How to use `overflow:hidden` to mask the corner radius of images contained with in a div.
- Writing code snippets in markdown.
- Creating hover states


To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```
```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('ðŸŽ‰')
}
```

If you want more help with writing markdown, we'd recommend checking out [The Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/) to learn more.

### Continued development

I want to continue learning about media queries and how to build responsive designs. Additionally, I had some trouble zooming in the image on the mobile design, so I have to look further into that. I decided not to bother with it for now.

I also had trouble aligning the card in the center of the page vertically using Flexbox. I tried adding the following to the parent element of the card:
```css
body {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: center;
  align-items: center;
}
```

However, it always just centered the content horizontally and did not add any vertical spacing above the card. Not sure why this kept happening.

### Useful resources

- [Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/) - This helped me write parts of this README.md file in markdown.
